# Life, the Universe and Everything

_Life, Universe and Everything_ (LUE for short) is a rogue-like, space
exploration, RTS and ship-building based on [Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com)
and inspired by _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.

## Modding

_LUE_ will feature modding capabilities.

_FTL_ have a great modding community and _LUE_ wants to ease the modding so we
can have a greater community than _FTL_ had with all the issues to mod the game.

The ideia is to implement almost everything in a scripting language like Lua or
Python (even for the main game).

What's going to be moddable:

- Races
- Systems
- Weapons
- Drones
- Augmentations
- Sectors
- Events
- (Missions)

## Unlockables

_LUE_ will feature unlockables.

The game will start with a small set of weapons, systems, augmentations, drones
and races and they will be unlocked during game.

There are some ways to unlock new things:

- Specific events
- Dominating another ship (_might_ unlock weapon/system/augmentations owned)
- Buying at shops
- (Missions)
- (more to think!)

## Missions

_LUE_ will have a set of missions that the player can choose from.

The missions are:

- Rebel Flagship Encounter (_FTL_ mission)
- (more to think!)

On the start of the mission (if not in a mission that gives some premade ship)
the player will buy a new ship (or use some already made one, from himself, other
players or premade).

## Ship Building Mechanics

_LUE_ will feature ship building mechanics.

When player starts a mission he can choose some premade ship or construct a new
one.

There will be limited resources to build a new ship. Ship tiles, doors, systems,
weapons and drones will be priced and the player can spend a certain amount of
_scrap_, the monetary unit in _FTL_ (might change during development), to
construct his/her ship.

During the mission he will encounter ship stations where he can improve his/her
ship.

What ship building will have:

- Buy rooms (player selected connected tiles and builds the room)
- Buy doors (rooms have to be reachable from piloting room)
- Buy system (and assign it to some room. Must have at least piloting and
    engines, OÂ² is optional because of non-oxigen consuming races)
- Buy augmentations
- Buy crew (only on mission start)

## Shops

Shops have some limited amount of fuel, scrap and drone parts to be bought.

Shops can sell weapons, systems, drones and crew (this _might_ be random or shops can
have some types that define what they have.

Weapons, systems, augmentations and drones not unlocked _might_ have a small to
appear in shops.

_On LUE, ships systems be bought at shops!_

## Races

_LUE_ will feature more races than _FTL_ have.

_Probably FTL_ races will change!

- Human
- Engi
- Mantis
- Zoltan
- Rockmen
- Slug
- Crystal
- Lanius
