# Life, the Universe and Everything

_Life, the Universe and Everything_ (LUE for short) is a rogue-like, space
exploration, RTS and ship-building based on [Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com).

Since _FTL_ will no longer be updated nor have a sequel, I aim to recreate the
_FTL_ experience and add direct support for modding.

Any help is welcome!
